1. **Data Source**: This project utilizes EEG data collected from my brain using a Muse 2 EEG device to generate different audio representations inspired by music theory, cosmology and Vedantic philosophy.

2. **EEG Bands**:
   - The code processes EEG data from the following bands:
     - **Delta Waves**: Low-frequency waves (0.5–4 Hz) associated with deep sleep and restorative states.
     - **Theta Waves**: Frequencies (4–8 Hz) linked to creativity, relaxation, and light meditation.
     - **Alpha Waves**: Mid-range waves (8–12 Hz) that reflect calm and present awareness.
     - **Beta Waves**: Higher frequencies (12–30 Hz) associated with active thinking and problem-solving.
     - **Gamma Waves**: The highest frequencies (>30 Hz), associated with learning, memory, and conscious focus.

3. **Code**:

    1.  **mind_wav.ipynb**: This file uses EEG data to create sound based on Western musical modes, like major and minor scales.

    2.  **pranava_wav.ipynb**: This file processes EEG data using microtones, which are smaller intervals than the typical Western semitone.
